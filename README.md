# ToDo-FE

My first attempts at Front-End programming complete with HTML, CSS, and JS. A simple ToDo list web page!  This website will not save your ToDos, so please do not rely on it fully for that purpose alone.  This site is hosted on GitHub pages.  To learn more about GitHub pages, visit: https://pages.github.com/.
